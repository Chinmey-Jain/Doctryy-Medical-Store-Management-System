# Doctryy-Medical-Store-Management-System
A webpage-based medical store management system named "Doctryy".
This project has the implementation of HTML, CSS & Javascript.
The backend has a Relational Database made with MySQL in Xampp.
The connection between the database and the website is established using PHP.
The programming for the front-end part was done using Visual Studio Code and testing was done using the Live Server extension.
It is not necessary to use the same IDE for development, it is solely the user's choice.
Also, some parameters were established in the database and in the JS code to check data like passwords, etc.
All the attachment files were kept in the same root directory.
These are all the major highlights of my project.
I hope it helps!!!
